## Personal node.js Modules
I have created some node.js modules that I use for personal projects.  These are modules I don't consider to be ground-breaking enough to be public npm modules, but I use them in multiple projects, so it's a good way to reuse the code.

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| [node-application-insights-logger](https://github.com/roncli/node-application-insights-logger) | A simple reusable class that can log to Azure Application Insights. |
| [node-database](https://github.com/roncli/node-database) | A simple reusable class to query a MS SQL Server database. |
